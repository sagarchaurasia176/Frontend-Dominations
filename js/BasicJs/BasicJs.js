// ðŸ‘‰ Difference b/w let and const is that, once you declared the let you can be modified but in the const you can't be modified
// const a = 12;
// a = 14; // here is error
// console.log(a);
// let b = 12;
// b = 13
// console.log(b)

// ðŸ‘‰ what is the difference b/w compiler and interpreter
/*
    compiler = means it trnaslate  the entire source code into the machine code before execution.
    interpreter = it execute line by line code.
